The .csv user import function lets you populate a Workspace with a large number of users in just one click.

The expected file must be in .csv format, with commas as separators, UTF-8 encoding and CR, LF, CRLF carriage returns.

It must contain two pieces of information per line: “user” and “role”. For users, the login or e-mail address (if unique) can be used. For roles, enter “u” or “user” to add a simple user and “wm” for a Workspace Manager.

Here's a file that you can base upon to fill with the data corresponding to your instance : [users-import.csv](./users-import.csv) .
