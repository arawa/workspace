Workspace allows managers to :
- Create shared workspaces
- Delegate management of each workspace to users (workspace managers) in order for them to
  - choose members
  - create groups
  - configure advanced permissions on workspace folders
- All through a simple unified interface, designed to simplify your users' experience and make them autonomous

This app is a Nextcloud extension of the Groupfolders app.

## Usage
### Requirements
- PHP < 7.4 (PHP 8 ongoing)
- Nextcloud 23+
  - Nextcloud 21 and 22 require our forked Groupfolders app available on https://github.com/arawa/groupfolders, from the `allow-admin-delegation-stable21` branch.

### Limit the Workspace app to specific groups

In your "application management" administrator interface, limit the application to the following groups: `GeneralManager` and `WorkspaceManagers`

### ðŸ”§ Configure Groupfolders for Workspace

To use the Wokspace app, you need to add the `GeneralManager` group in the `Group folders` field of the `Administration privileges` page.

`Settings` > `Admin privileges` from admin section.
