# Workspace

Workspace allows managers to : 
- create shared workspaces
- delegate management of each workspace to users (workspace managers)  in order for them to
  - choose members
  - create groups 
  - configure advanced permissions on workspace folders
- all through a simple unified interface

This app is a Nextcloud extension of the Groupfolders app.
