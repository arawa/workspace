Workspace allows managers to :
- Create shared workspaces
- Delegate management of each workspace to users (workspace managers) in order for them to :
  - choose members
  - create groups
  - configure advanced permissions on workspace folders
- All through a simple unified interface, designed to simplify your users' experience and make them autonomous

This app is a Nextcloud extension of the Groupfolders app.
